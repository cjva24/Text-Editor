## Description
Jate is a browser-based text editor. It's a single-page application that meets the criteria of a Progressive Web App (PWA). It's particularly useful for developers to create and save notes or code snippets, with or without an internet connection, ensuring reliable access to them later.

## Installation
Jate can be run directly in the browser using the deployed app link. Alternatively, you can run it locally by following these steps:
- Clone the repository from GitHub
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- Run `npm start`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser

## Usage
Simply type any code snippet or note into the editor, and it will be automatically saved. Additionally, it can be installed as a PWA for offline access.
